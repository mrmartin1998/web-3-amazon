# Web3 Amazon Marketplace

## Description
**Web3 Amazon Marketplace** is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to simulate an e-commerce store's operations on the Ethereum blockchain. This project leverages smart contracts to offer a platform where users can securely list, view, and purchase items using Ether (ETH). It highlights the capabilities of blockchain technology in creating a transparent and trustless marketplace environment.

## Technologies Used
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: Provides a decentralized platform for executing smart contracts.
- **Solidity**: High-level language designed for developing smart contracts on Ethereum.
- **web3.js**: JavaScript library that enables interaction with Ethereum nodes via HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket.
- **Truffle Suite**: Comprehensive development environment for blockchain applications.
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain simulator for Ethereum development, facilitating easy DApp testing.
- **MetaMask**: Cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to blockchain apps, used for Ethereum transactions.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used to structure and design the DApp's user interface.

## Features
- **Product Listing**: Enables users to list products with detailed attributes.
- **Product Purchasing**: Allows purchases using ETH with real-time blockchain updates.
- **Dynamic Content**: The UI updates dynamically as products are added or sold.
- **Transparency**: Ensures that all transactions are verifiable on the blockchain for increased trust.
