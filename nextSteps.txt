Step 2: Shopping Cart System
Here's a step-by-step for implementing a shopping cart:

 Define a shoppingCart array in your app.js.
 Create functions to add items to the cart, remove items, and update the display.
 Implement the checkout function that will create transactions for the items in the cart.
Consideration: If your contract doesn't support batch buying, you might need to send individual transactions for each item, which isn't ideal. If possible, modify the smart contract to handle multiple items in a single transaction.

Step 3: Order History
Here's how you can display the order history:

 Define a fetchOrderHistory function that reads the Buy events emitted by the contract.
 Filter events by the user's address to display only their orders.
 Display the fetched order history in the UI.
Step 4: User Interface
Lastly, to ensure all the features are properly used and visible:

 Create a section in the UI for the connected account, displaying the address and balance.
 Design a user-friendly shopping cart interface, showing items added, total cost, and an option to remove items.
 Develop a clean order history section showing past purchases, with details like item names, quantities, and dates.
